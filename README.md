# meatClassifier
Classify meat freshness into three groups using CNN

## Few Fun EDA
: Average pixel RGB, and Plotting Distribution

## Basic CNN
: Conv - Maxpool - Conv - Maxpool - Dense(128) - Dense(3)/output

## EarlyStopping & BatchNormalization
: Just adding those layers in the middle of them

## GridSearchCV
: Finding best parameters
(idk it is still worthy in very deep networks)

## Voting Ensemble
: I made this one, because it was easy. I used 13 models, which I uploaded

this is from my HighSchool Project in AI Class

To conclude, this was fun tbh
